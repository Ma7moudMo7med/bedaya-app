A clean, well-structured learning platform built with **ASP.NET MVC (.NET 8)** using an **N-Tier architecture** (Presentation ▶︎ BLL ▶︎ DAL ▶︎ Database). The platform includes three roles — **Admin, Instructor, and Student** — each with dedicated dashboards and role-specific permissions.

* 👤 **Roles** — Admin, Instructor, Student (separate dashboards & permissions).
* 💳 **Payments** — **PayMob** integrated; easy to add PayPal, Fawry, or wallets.
* 🔎 **Search & Filters** — Advanced search for courses, instructors, and categories.
* 📦 **Subscription System** — Single subscription type with admin-controlled limits.
* 🎬 **Media** — Upload video lessons (on-disk or cloud storage).

### Layers — Responsibilities

---
* **Presentation Layer**

  * MVC Controllers, Views, ViewModels
  * Thin controllers — delegate logic to BLL

* **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**

  * Core application rules, services, business validation
  * Interfaces for payment, storage, and search
  * DTOs and mapping (AutoMapper)

* **Data Access Layer (DAL)**

  * EF Core repositories, unit-of-work, migrations
  * Implementation of storage, seeding, and query optimizations

* **Database**

  * SQL Server with migrations & seed data

---

## 🔑 Seed Admin (Development)
> [!CAUTION]
> Use this seeded admin account for local development/testing ONLY.
* **Email:** `admin@gmail.com`
* **Password:** `Admin@123`

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Developer)

### Prerequisites
* .NET 8 SDK
* SQL Server / LocalDB
* Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code

### Quick Setup

1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ma7moudMo7med/bedaya-app.git
cd bedaya-app
```

2. Configure connection string & keys in `appsettings.Development.json` or user secrets
3. Apply EF migrations & seed data

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/Your.DAL/Your.DAL.csproj --startup-project src/Your.Presentation/Your.Presentation.csproj
```

4. Run the web project

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Your.Presentation/Your.Presentation.csproj
 
```

## 🔐 Configuration (Important)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` are **not included** in the repository for security reasons. You must create them manually before running the project.

### 📄 Step 1: Create appsettings.Development.json
Inside your **Presentation (MVC)** project root, create a file named `appsettings.Development.json` and paste the following structure:

```json
{
  "PaymobSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_PAYMOB_API_KEY",
    "IframeId": "YOUR_IFRAME_ID",
    "IntegrationId": "YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID",
    "BaseUrl": "[https://accept.paymob.com/api](https://accept.paymob.com/api)",
    "Hmac": "YOUR_PAYMOB_HMAC"
  },
  "SMTP": {
    "Host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "Port": 587,
    "User": "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com",
    "Pass": "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD",
    "From": "Bedaya_Platform@gmail.com"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "cs": "Server=.;Database=BedayaDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

### 🛠️ Development Tips
✅ Keep controllers thin; place business rules in BLL.

✅ Use DTOs and AutoMapper for mapping domain models.

✅ Store credentials securely (User Secrets / Key Vault) for production.

✅ Seed admin and sample data only in development environments.
